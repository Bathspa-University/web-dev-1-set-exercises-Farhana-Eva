        <h2><u>Plot</u></h2>
        <p>Game of Thrones follows the noble families of Westeros as they vie for control of the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.Game of Thrones follows a large cast of characters and interwoven story arcs. It is primarily set on the fictional continent of Westeros, which is divided into the Seven Kingdoms and the lands in the far North beyond “the Wall,” an enormous wall of fortified ice. The Seven Kingdoms is a realm composed of seven once independent kingdoms that have been, to greater or lesser degrees, unified under a single monarch, who sits on the Iron Throne. The planet on which Westeros is found has seasons of variable lengths, with summers and winters often lasting for many years.The series focuses on several noble houses of Westeros and a complicated, multiparty war for the Iron Throne that features shifting conflicts, alliances, and betrayals. Key houses include the Starks, who rule in the North; the Lannisters, a wealthy family from the West who have married into the royal line; the Baratheons, who at the outset hold the Iron Throne; and the Targaryens, who once controlled the Iron Throne using dragons but who have been nearly wiped out by the time the story begins.

            This war develops after the death of King Robert Baratheon and the resulting feud between his friend and ally Lord Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) and Robert’s widow, Queen Cersei Lannister, and her children. The conflict draws in two of the Stark children, Robb and Sansa, while the younger children Arya and Bran find themselves on their own terrifying adventures. Jon Snow, raised as a bastard member of the Stark family, serves in the Night’s Watch, a military organization that defends the Seven Kingdoms from forces beyond the Wall. Cersei’s brothers Jaime and Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) also play key roles. Exiled on the continent of Essos, Daenerys Targaryen seeks to return to Westeros with dragons and an army in order to reclaim the Iron Throne for House Targaryen.</p>
